Hope you are doing well.

I am fine mam
The summer internship with Akamai ended on August 2025.

I am not in any internship with any companies as of right now mam.

11/12/25, 3:11 pm - Shakthi Nandan: Yes mam
I was adviced by our HOD and the placement cell to be transparent about the then possible internship opportunity with Akamai mam.

After email communication through the Placement Officer and Akamai, I was not offered any position with Akamai mam. 

I was and am very much still interested in joining TekMedia regardless mam
